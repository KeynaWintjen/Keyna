# Greetings! Or as they say from where I’m from, “Hey, Y’all!”  Yep – I am as southern as cornbread and grits.  Although I was born in Memphis where Elvis is king and barbecue is a religion, I call Alabama home - Roll Tide! I am currently working at Santa Fe College where I serve as the Activity Coordinator of the Learning Commons, SF's hub for academic support. In this role, I have developed an academic success coaching program and manage those serving as success coaches. I facilitate ongoing professional development training for faculty and staff which leverages their skills and experience to support students in identifying and developing skills to achieve their academic and personal goals. I really like being an academic coach because I enjoy working with students, hearing what students have to say about college life, and getting to be a part of each student's success plan.  Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and gardening.  My secret indulgences are playing Candy Crush (Ask me what level I am on), watching Judge Judy, and scrolling through TikTok.
